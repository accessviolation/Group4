You will need to install PHP to run this code. 
I'm assuming you are running Windows.
Download it from here: http://windows.php.net/downloads/releases/php-7.0.12-nts-Win32-VC14-x86.zip

Once downloaded extract the files from the zip into a folder on your computer. 
I would suggest extracting the files to C:\php
You will need to add C:\php to your environment variables. If you are using Windows 7 type in the search bar - 'edit the system environment variables'
On the System Properties dialog box click 'Environment Variables'
In the bottom box under 'System Variables' Find 'PATH', click on it, and click 'Edit'. Add C:\php to the list. All entries are seperated by semicolons
Make sure your php.ini file matches the one uploaded here.
